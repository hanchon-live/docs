# Introduction
We are going to allow the user to register and generate a JWT token to operate with our API (`FastAPI`) using Google LogIn.

# Requirements
This guide assumes you already have installed in your system `python3`.

# Setting up the environment
We need to install [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), so we are going to create a virtual environment, activate it and use `pip` to install the lib.

```
mkdir fastapi-googlelogin
cd fastapi-googlelogin
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi
```
